# 100 Guesstimates Journey

This repository is where I solve guesstimates to improve my problem-solving and critical-thinking skills.  
I’m using this space to track my progress and stay consistent.

## 📌 How I’m Solving These
- I have a list of 100 guesstimate questions.  
- I am aiming at solving one question daily in my notebook first.  
- Then I write the structured solution here in a clean and simple way.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- Every question will have its own folder.
- Inside each folder, there will be a `README.md` containing:
  - The question  
  - My approach  
  - Assumptions  
  - Step-by-step breakdown  
  - Final answer  


## 🚀 My Goal
To stay consistent, think better, and sharpen my ability to break big problems into smaller parts.
