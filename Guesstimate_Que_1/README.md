## 🎯 Final Question
Estimate the electricity consumption of India for a month (residential only), in terms of units.

---

## 1. Clarifying Questions Asked

Before solving, the following clarifications were made:
- Whether the scope was India or global  
- Time period (day/week/month/year)  
- Whether consumption should be estimated in money or units  
- Whether to consider any specific state  
- Whether energy source bifurcation (solar/green/thermal) is needed  
- Whether residential or commercial consumption  

Final clarified question:
**Estimate the residential electricity consumption of India for one month in units.**

## 2. Step 1: Population Segmentation

Assumed population of India: **140 crore**

Segmentation:
- Urban population: **30% = 420 million**
- Rural population: **70% = 980 million**

For easier calculations:
- Urban approximated to **400 million**
- Rural approximated to **1000 million**

---

## 3. Step 2: Household Count

Assumed household size:
- Urban: **4 people per household**
- Rural: **5 people per household**

Household calculations:
- Urban households = `400 million / 4 = 100 million`
- Rural households = `1000 million / 5 = 200 million`

---

## 4. Step 3: Segmentation of Households

### Urban household segmentation:
| Category | % Share | Household Count |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| High    | 10%     | 10 million      |
| Middle  | 40%     | 40 million      |
| Low     | 50%     | 50 million      |

### Rural household segmentation:
| Category | % Share | Household Count |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| High    | 10%     | 20 million      |
| Middle  | 30%     | 60 million      |
| Low     | 60%     | 120 million     |

---

## 5. Step 4: Monthly Electricity Consumption Assumptions

### Urban consumption per household:
- High: **2000 units/month**
- Middle: **1000 units/month**
- Low: **500 units/month**

### Rural consumption per household:
- High: **1000 units/month**
- Middle: **500 units/month**
- Low: **200 units/month**

---

## 6. Step 5: Total Consumption Calculations

### Urban:
- High = `10 million × 2000 = 20,000 million units`
- Middle = `40 million × 1000 = 40,000 million units`
- Low = `50 million × 500 = 25,000 million units`

Total Urban Consumption =  
`20,000 million + 40,000 million + 25,000 million = 75,000 million units`

---

### Rural:
- High = `20 million × 1000 = 20,000 million units`
- Middle = `60 million × 500 = 30,000 million units`
- Low = `120 million × 200 = 24,000 million units`

Total Rural Consumption =  
`20,000 million + 30,000 million + 24,000 million = 74,000 million units`

---

## 7. Final Total

Grand Total Electricity Consumption =  
`Urban + Rural = 75,000 million + 74,000 million = 149,000 million units`

Final Answer:  
**India consumes approximately 149 billion units of electricity per month in residential households.**

---

## Summary
India’s monthly residential electricity consumption is estimated to be **149 billion units**, based on:
- Population segmentation (urban/rural)
- Household size assumptions
- Socio-economic segmentation
- Monthly consumption patterns for each segment
